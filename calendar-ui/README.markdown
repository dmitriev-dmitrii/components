 In issue 171 of the CSS-Tricks Newsletter (https://css-tricks.com/newsletter/171/), Robin explains how he likes to ask interviewers to recreate a calendar UI. He goes on to explain how using a `<table>` in this case has its merits as a calendar is inherently tablature data. This is something that I have always wanted to build, so I thought I would give it a shot.

Click and drag to set a date range, or use the keyboard to tab between dates and select them with the enter key.
